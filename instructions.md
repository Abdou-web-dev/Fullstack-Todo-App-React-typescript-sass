# une fois la tache créee, son statut initial est : en attente.

# Le statut peut donc etre modifié soit en : 'validé' ou 'réalisé (done)'.

Color Scheme: Consider refining the color scheme to ensure consistency and accessibility. Choose colors that complement each other and provide good contrast for text and icons. Additionally, use color to signify different task states or priorities effectively.
Task Status Labels: Along with status icons, include text labels next to them to explicitly indicate the status of each task (e.g., "Validated" and "Needs Attention"). This will make it easier for users to understand the meaning of the icons at a glance.
Visual Hierarchy: Ensure that important elements such as task names, status indicators, and action buttons are visually prominent and easily distinguishable. Use font size, weight, and color to create a clear visual hierarchy that guides users' attention to the most relevant information.
Hover Effects: Implement subtle hover effects for interactive elements like buttons and task cards to provide feedback and improve interactivity. For example, change the background color or add a slight shadow when users hover over a task card or button.
Mobile Responsiveness: Optimize the UI layout for mobile devices to ensure a seamless experience across different screen sizes. Consider using responsive design techniques such as fluid grids and flexible images to adapt the UI elements dynamically based on the device viewport.
Feedback Mechanisms: Incorporate feedback mechanisms such as success messages or error notifications to provide feedback to users when they perform actions like creating, updating, or deleting tasks. This helps users understand the outcome of their actions and reduces confusion.
User Preferences: Allow users to customize their task app experience by providing options to adjust settings such as color themes, sorting preferences, and notification preferences. This personalization can enhance user satisfaction and engagement.
Accessibility: Ensure that the UI is accessible to users with disabilities by following best practices for accessibility. This includes using semantic HTML elements, providing alternative text for images, and ensuring proper contrast ratios for text and background colors.
